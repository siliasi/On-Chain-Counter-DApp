# On-Chain Counter DApp

A simple decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Monad Testnet. The app features a counter that can be incremented or decremented, with all changes stored on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Connect Wallet**: Connect your Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Monad Testnet.
- **View Counter**: Display the current value of the on-chain counter.
- **Increment Counter**: Increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Counter**: Decrease the counter value by 1 (if greater than 0).
- **Disconnect Wallet**: Disconnect your wallet and reset the app.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A Web3 wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/))
- Testnet MON tokens (for gas fees on the Monad Testnet)
